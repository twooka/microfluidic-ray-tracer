# Lab Data: Water Droplets in Oil Medium

This repository contains lab data for various setups of water droplets passing through an oil medium. Each setup is organized into folders named according to the flow rates of the dispersed and continuous phases.

## Folder Structure

Each folder is named in the format `N-M`, where:
- `N` represents the flow rate of the dispersed phase (water droplets).
- `M` represents the flow rate of the continuous phase (oil medium).

### Contents of Each Folder

- **Image**: A `.bmp` file showing a picture of the droplet.
- **Graph**: A figure containing the graphed data of the test.
- **Raw Data**: A `.csv` file with the raw data of the test.

## Example

```
lab_data/
├── 1-2/
│   ├── droplet.bmp
│   ├── graph.png
│   └── data.csv
├── 2-3/
│   ├── droplet.bmp
│   ├── graph.png
│   └── data.csv
└── ...
```

## Usage

To analyze the data, navigate to the respective folder and review the provided files.

- **Image**: Visual representation of the droplet.
- **Graph**: Analyze the graphical data.
- **Raw Data**: Use the CSV file for detailed data analysis.

Feel free to explore the different setups and compare the results.
